Currently an engineer at Pivotal since Jan, 2016. I love tacos, open source,
rock climbing, and League of Legends. I'm always looking to improve the software
delivery process. Right now that means TDD, pair programming, CI/CD, user
centered design, lean product management, and a whole bunch of other things.
