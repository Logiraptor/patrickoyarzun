Currently an engineering manager at Pivotal Labs since Jan, 2016.
I love tacos, open source, and League of Legends. I always looking to
improve the software delivery process. Right now that means TDD,
pair programming, CI/CD, user centered design, lean product management,
and a whole bunch of other things.
